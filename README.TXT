You add the component, and then select it, and put it on the form.  Then you goto the code, and when you want to search, you can use the following functions:

Additemsearch - searches a database for a matching whole word, and then returns the results into a listbox, or combo box that you specify
AdvAdditemsearch  - same as above, except you can specify how much of the word you are searching for needs to match inorder for it to be recorded as a result
Letteradditemsearch - same as above, except, it looks for a brauder range ie:

if the search word is 'Help' then it searches for :
'He', 'el', lp'.  So the following words would match:
hell
he
kelp
help...
It is th best one.

The textsearch, Advtextsearch, and letter text search are the same as above, except they search a text box, and highlight the words when they find them.
